Whyboe's the name, learning coding thru python. In the summer of 2022 I want to be able to program games and algorythm-visualisers using pygame. 

Recently got back into programming, looking for a good python course. Also, trying to get this A* algo to hook into a recursive-backtracked-generated maze generator.
